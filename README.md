You're Gonna Need A Bigger Quote is the capstone project that I completed for the front-end portion of my time at the Nashville Software School.

## What It Does
YGNABQ is, simply, a movie quote database. The user is able to quickly create an account using their Gmail address, so that they may take part in some of the application's coolest features.

Speaking of, here are some of the main features of the app:
- For each movie quote, you can see metadata such as the quote itself, the character in the film who said it, the film's release date, and the option to save the quote to your "favorites" list.
- On the homepage, you can view the random movie quote of the day.
