You're Gonna Need A Bigger Quote is the capstone project that I completed for the front-end portion of my time at the Nashville Software School.

## What It Does
YGNABQ is a movie quote database which allows the user to create an account using their Gmail address, so that they may take part in some of the application's coolest features, such as:
- For each movie quote, the user can see metadata such as the quote itself, the character in the film who said it, and the film's release date.
- On the homepage, you can view the random movie quote of the day.
- The user can search for a particular movie quote. If that movie quote doesn't exist in the database, they are able to add said quote.
- Each user has their own "Favorites" list, where they can add any movie quote to reference at a later date.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS & Sass, and Bootstrap 3
- JavaScript and AngularJS
- Google's Firebase
